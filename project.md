# SalesLens — Professional Analysis, Requirements & Build Plan
**Multi-source Sales Data Unification Platform**

---

# PART 1 — MULTI-LEVEL ANALYSIS

---

## Analysis 1: FURPS+ (Rational/Grady Booch)
*Classifies all system concerns before requirements are written. Prevents missing non-functional requirements early.*

### F — Functionality
- Ingest sales data from CSV, Excel, Legacy JDBC databases, and live Kafka streams
- Infer schemas from raw source data without requiring upfront schema definition
- Map heterogeneous source fields to a fixed canonical sales schema
- Detect and persist data quality violations across 6 dimensions
- Detect cross-source conflicts at the entity-field level
- Load unified, quality-scored records into a canonical queryable store
- Expose all pipeline state (jobs, issues, conflicts, schemas, mappings) via REST API
- JWT-based auth with role separation (already partially built)

### U — Usability
- A non-engineer user must be able to register a data source via an API call with minimal config
- Field mappings inferred with low confidence must surface clearly for user confirmation before data flows
- Conflicts must be human-readable: "Source A says customer segment is Consumer, Source B says Corporate"
- Canonical data must be queryable by external tools via standard SQL (direct Postgres access)

### R — Reliability
- A bad record from one source must not block processing of other records in the same batch
- A failed ingestion job must be retryable without re-registering the source
- Staging records persist until canonical loading is confirmed — no silent data loss
- Kafka consumer failures must not result in message loss (offset committed only after successful processing)

### P — Performance
- Batch ingestion (CSV, Excel, JDBC) does not need to be real-time; throughput over latency
- Live stream ingestion (Kafka) should process within seconds of arrival
- Canonical query API must be fast — it reads pre-unified data, not raw staging tables
- Quality scoring runs asynchronously and does not block the ingestion acknowledgement

### S — Supportability
- All pipeline stages must produce observable output (job status, record counts, issue counts)
- Flyway migrations — schema is versioned and reproducible
- Docker Compose — entire stack runs with one command locally
- Every field transformation is logged in the lineage store — debuggable after the fact

### + Constraints
- Free tier infrastructure only (local Docker Compose is primary target)
- Spring Boot 4, Java, Postgres — no switching languages or databases
- Existing User + JWT + BCrypt must be reused, not rewritten
- No paid managed Kafka — runs in Docker locally

### + Interface
- REST API consumed by frontend (React/Vue)
- Canonical store directly queryable via Postgres connection by external tools (Tableau, Grafana, psql)
- File upload via multipart form POST

### + Implementation
- Spring Batch for file and JDBC ingestion (built for exactly this)
- Kafka for live stream ingestion only (not used as internal pipeline bus to keep complexity manageable while learning)
- OpenCSV for CSV parsing, Apache POI for Excel
- Apache Commons Text for fuzzy field name matching
- MapStruct for DTO/entity mapping

---

## Analysis 2: Domain-Driven Design — Bounded Context Mapping
*Identifies which parts of the system are genuinely separate concerns and should not bleed into each other.*

### Bounded Context 1: Source Management
**Responsibility:** Know about data sources, their connection config, trust levels, and schemas
**Owns:** DataSource, SourceSchema, FieldDefinition, DataProfile
**Does not own:** anything canonical, anything about quality rules

### Bounded Context 2: Ingestion & Staging
**Responsibility:** Pull data from sources in their native format, land it in staging without transformation
**Owns:** IngestionJob, StagedRecord
**Does not own:** what happens to staged records, schema inference

### Bounded Context 3: Schema Inference & Mapping
**Responsibility:** Understand what a source's data looks like and map it to the canonical schema
**Owns:** SchemaVersion, FieldMapping, TransformRule, MappingConfidence
**Does not own:** quality rules, canonical data

### Bounded Context 4: Quality
**Responsibility:** Evaluate data against all six quality dimensions, score it, persist issues
**Owns:** QualityRun, QualityScore, QualityIssue, QualityRule, DataProfile (statistical baseline)
**Does not own:** what to do with bad records beyond flagging them

### Bounded Context 5: Conflict Detection & Resolution
**Responsibility:** When loading an entity that already exists from another source, detect disagreements and apply or flag resolution
**Owns:** ConflictRecord, ResolutionStrategy
**Does not own:** quality checks, loading logic

### Bounded Context 6: Canonical Store
**Responsibility:** Own the unified, trusted representation of sales data
**Owns:** Customer, Product, Salesperson, Region, Order, OrderLineItem, DataLineage
**Does not own:** how data got here or where it came from (all source info is in lineage)

### Key insight from DDD:
Quality and conflict are **separate concerns** — a record can be individually valid (passes quality) but still conflict with another source's version of the same entity. These run sequentially: quality first, then conflict check on the survivors.

## Analysis 3: Event Storming (Alberto Brandolini)
*Maps the flow as domain events — what happens, in order, as commands are issued.*

```
COMMAND                     → DOMAIN EVENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Register Data Source        → DataSourceRegistered
Upload CSV / Excel File     → IngestionJobCreated → RecordStaged (×N)
Schedule JDBC Pull          → IngestionJobCreated → RecordStaged (×N)
Receive Kafka Message       → RecordStaged
                            → SchemaInferred          (first time for source)
                            → SchemaDriftDetected     (if changed)
Confirm Field Mapping       → FieldMappingConfirmed
                            → FieldMappingPending     (low confidence, needs review)
Process Staged Record       → RecordTransformed
                            → QualityIssueDetected    (per violation)
                            → QualityScoreComputed    (per batch)
Load Transformed Record     → ConflictDetected        (if entity exists from another source)
                            → ConflictFlagged
                            → CanonicalRecordCreated  (new entity)
                            → CanonicalRecordUpdated  (existing entity, no conflict)
                            → LineageRecordWritten
Acknowledge Conflict        → ConflictResolved / ConflictSuppressed
Query Canonical Data        → (read side — no event, just a query)
```

### Aggregates (things that own their own consistency):
- **IngestionJob** — owns its staged records and status transitions
- **SourceSchema** — owns its field definitions and version history
- **QualityRun** — owns its issues and scores
- **CanonicalEntity (Customer, Product, etc.)** — owns its external refs and conflict state

*Shows what software containers exist and how they communicate.*

## Analysis 5: MoSCoW Prioritization
*Separates what makes the system work from what makes it impressive.*

### Must Have (system is broken without these)
- Source registration
- CSV ingestion via Spring Batch
- Schema inference (type detection, null rates, format patterns)
- Semantic field mapping with confidence score
- Mapping confirmation flow (PENDING → CONFIRMED)
- Completeness, validity, uniqueness quality checks
- Cross-source conflict detection at field level
- Canonical store load with external_refs JSONB
- Record-level lineage
- Quality score per batch
- All pipeline state exposed via REST API

### Should Have (system is weak without these)
- Excel ingestion
- JDBC connector with scheduling
- Consistency and timeliness quality dimensions
- Statistical profiling (null rate drift, distribution baseline)
- Conflict resolution strategies (TRUST_HIERARCHY, LATEST_WINS)
- Redis caching for quality scores and conflict summaries
- Schema drift detection between ingestions
- Kafka live stream connector
- React/Vue frontend (source mgmt, quality dashboard, conflict review)

### Could Have (good to have, not core)
- Accuracy dimension (reference value set matching)
- Auto-suppression of low-severity conflicts
- Scheduled re-profiling
- Canonical data query API with filters (beyond direct SQL access)
- Export of canonical data as CSV

### Won't Have (explicitly out of scope)
- ML-based anomaly detection
- Predictive analytics on sales data
- CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot) via REST
- Email/webhook alerting
- Multi-tenant architecture
- User-defined canonical schema (fixed to sales domain)

---

## Analysis 6: RAID Analysis
*Professional risk management before a line of code is written.*

### Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kafka learning curve delays Phase 8 | High | Medium | Keep Kafka only for live streams, not internal pipeline bus. Do it last |
| Schema inference produces wrong type for ambiguous fields | High | Medium | Flag inference confidence below 0.8, require user confirmation |
| Spring Batch complexity for simple CSV reads | Medium | Medium | Use SimpleJob pattern first, not full Chunk-oriented processing |
| Conflict detection creates too many false positives | Medium | High | Define precise conflict rules per entity type before coding |
| Excel files with merged cells / complex formatting | High | Low | Scope: flat tabular Excel only, document limitation clearly |
| JDBC connector requires network access to legacy DB | Medium | High | Use local Postgres as the JDBC target during development |

### Assumptions
- The canonical schema is fixed to the sales domain (Customer, Product, Salesperson, Region, Order, OrderLineItem). It does not need to be user-configurable.
- Sources are trusted enough that their data is worth processing — no source-level rejection.
- A single Spring Boot instance is sufficient (no horizontal scaling needed for prototype).
- The canonical Postgres schema is directly accessible to external tools — no additional query layer needed.
- User already has working JWT auth with ADMIN and ANALYST roles.

### Issues (known before starting)
- Docker Compose not yet set up — must be resolved in Phase 1 before anything else.
- No Kafka experience — must do a standalone Kafka proof-of-concept before integrating with the application.
- Spring Batch not in current dependencies — must be added.

### Dependencies
- Apache POI for Excel (external lib, well-maintained)
- OpenCSV for CSV (external lib, well-maintained)
- Apache Commons Text for Levenshtein distance in semantic mapping (lightweight, stable)
- MapStruct for DTO mapping (annotation processor, must configure with Lombok correctly)
- Spring Kafka, Spring Data Redis, Spring Batch (all Spring-managed, stable)
- Flyway (must order migrations correctly — no going back once applied)

# PART 2 — REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

---

## Functional Requirements

### FR-01: Source Management
- FR-01.1: User can register a data source with a name, type, and connection config
- FR-01.2: Source types supported: CSV_FILE, EXCEL_FILE, JDBC_POSTGRES, JDBC_MYSQL, KAFKA_STREAM
- FR-01.3: Each source has a trust score (0.0–1.0) set by the user, used in conflict resolution
- FR-01.4: Source can be marked ACTIVE or INACTIVE
- FR-01.5: Source stores its last sync timestamp

### FR-02: Ingestion
- FR-02.1: CSV and Excel files uploaded via multipart POST endpoint, processed by Spring Batch
- FR-02.2: JDBC sources pulled on a schedule configured per source (cron expression stored on source)
- FR-02.3: Kafka sources receive events continuously on a configured topic
- FR-02.4: Every ingestion execution creates an IngestionJob with status tracking (PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED / PARTIAL / FAILED)
- FR-02.5: Every raw record is written to StagedRecord before any processing
- FR-02.6: A failed job can be retried without re-registering the source
- FR-02.7: Record counts tracked per job: total read, transformed, quality_passed, quality_failed, loaded, conflicted

### FR-03: Schema Inference
- FR-03.1: On first ingestion from a source, system infers a SourceSchema from the raw data
- FR-03.2: Type detection must support: INTEGER, DECIMAL, BOOLEAN, DATE, DATETIME, EMAIL, PHONE, CURRENCY_AMOUNT, CATEGORY (low-cardinality string), FREE_TEXT
- FR-03.3: Date format patterns detected (e.g. "dd/MM/yyyy", "MMM d, yyyy", "yyyy-MM-dd")
- FR-03.4: Per-field statistics computed: null_rate, unique_count, top_10_values, min, max (numeric), sample_values
- FR-03.5: On subsequent ingestions, new schema compared against stored schema. If fields added, removed, or type-changed: SchemaDriftEvent written, new SourceSchema version created
- FR-03.6: Schema and profile written to DB and surfaced via API

### FR-04: Semantic Field Mapping
- FR-04.1: After schema inference, the system dynamically attempts to map source fields to canonical fields using a hybrid approach combining heuristic checks with a local LLM matching step.
- FR-04.2: Mapping engine queries a local Ollama endpoint `http://localhost:11434` with model `qwen3.5:9b` (configurable). To provide proper data distribution context, the engine retrieves 10 randomized sample values from existing canonical tables, alongside 10 sample values from the newly ingested data source CSV, and instructs the LLM to yield a structured JSON mapping decision with high confidence.
- FR-04.3: LLM mapping runs exactly once per data source schema creation or drift detection. Calculated field mappings are persisted in the `field_mappings` table and reused sequentially for subsequent batch uploads without recurring LLM costs.
- FR-04.4: Mappings with confidence ≥ 0.80 set to AUTO_CONFIRMED and proceed without user action. Mappings with confidence < 0.80 set to PENDING — data from those fields does not flow to target attributes until user confirms or overrides.
- FR-04.5: User can confirm, override, or ignore any mapping via API.
- FR-04.6: Unmapped incoming source fields or fields that don't match any standard canonical attributes are NOT ignored or discarded. They are routed into a flexible `custom_fields` or `additional_attributes` JSONB column on the target canonical table (Option A).
- FR-04.7: Support Attribute Promotion/Demotion:
  - **Promotion**: Provide an API to promote a specific JSONB key within `additional_attributes` into a first-class, dedicated column in the canonical Postgres table schema. This dynamic operation runs database DDL queries (`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`), migrates historical JSONB values, and updates metadata so future mappings load directly to the dedicated column.
  - **Demotion**: Provide an API to demote an existing dedicated column back into a key within the `additional_attributes` JSONB column, migrating values back into the JSONB payload and dropping the column.

### FR-05: Data Quality Engine
- FR-05.1: Quality evaluation runs per IngestionJob after transformation, before canonical load
- FR-05.2: Six dimensions evaluated:
  - **Completeness**: % of non-null values for each required canonical field
  - **Validity**: value conforms to inferred type, format pattern, and any configured rules
  - **Uniqueness**: no duplicate records by natural key (order_id, customer external_ref, product SKU) within this batch and against canonical store
  - **Consistency**: cross-field rules (line_total = quantity × unit_price, order total = sum of line totals, order_date ≤ today)
  - **Timeliness**: order_date not more than 2 years in the past (configurable), records not arriving more than N days after the period they represent
  - **Accuracy**: field values fall within known reference sets where applicable (currency codes ISO-4217, country codes ISO-3166)
- FR-05.3: Every violation writes a QualityIssue with: field, rule_code, severity (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL), message, dimension
- FR-05.4: QualityScore computed per job: score per dimension (0.0–1.0) + overall weighted score + letter grade
- FR-05.5: Records with CRITICAL issues are not loaded to canonical. Records with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW issues are loaded but flagged.
- FR-05.6: QualityRule is a first-class entity — user can add custom rules via API without redeployment
- FR-05.7: Quality scores tracked over time per source for trend visibility

### FR-06: Conflict Detection & Resolution
- FR-06.1: A conflict occurs when a canonical entity already exists (loaded from a different source) and the incoming record provides a different value for the same field
- FR-06.2: Conflict scope — applies to: Customer (segment, region), Product (unit_price, category), Salesperson (territory, team), Order (total_amount)
- FR-06.3: Every detected conflict writes a ConflictRecord: source_a, source_b, field, value_a, value_b, entity type, entity canonical id
- FR-06.4: Resolution strategies (configured per source pair or entity type):
  - `TRUST_HIERARCHY`: source with higher trust score wins
  - `LATEST_WINS`: source with more recent updated_at wins
  - `FLAGGED_FOR_REVIEW`: no auto-resolution, human decides via API
  - FLAGGED_FOR_REVIEW is default.
- FR-06.5: Conflict does not block loading — canonical record is loaded with the winning value and the conflict is persisted alongside
- FR-06.6: User can acknowledge, resolve, or suppress any conflict via API
- FR-06.7: Canonical record carries has_conflicts: true flag when unresolved conflicts exist

### FR-07: Canonical Store
- FR-07.1: Six canonical tables: customers, products, salespersons, regions, orders, order_line_items.
- FR-07.2: Each entity stores:
  - `external_refs` as JSONB: {"crm": "C-123", "erp": "1045"}
  - `additional_attributes` as JSONB: Catch-all storage for unmapped or flexible dynamic source fields that have not been promoted to dedicated schema columns.
- FR-07.3: Each entity carries: primary_source_id, quality_score, has_conflicts, created_at, updated_at
- FR-07.4: Canonical schema is in its own Postgres schema (`canonical`) — directly queryable by external tools
- FR-07.5: No business logic in canonical tables — they are a read target, not a processing target

### FR-08: Data Lineage
- FR-08.1: Every canonical record has a lineage record linking it to: source, ingestion job, staged record, list of transformations applied
- FR-08.2: Transformations stored as ordered JSON array: [{step, from_field, to_field, rule, input_value, output_value}]
- FR-08.3: Lineage queryable per canonical record via API

### FR-09: API
- FR-09.1: All pipeline state accessible via REST API (sources, jobs, schemas, mappings, quality issues, scores, conflicts, lineage)
- FR-09.2: All list endpoints paginated with Pageable
- FR-09.3: Quality issues filterable by: source, dimension, severity, job, resolution status
- FR-09.4: Conflicts filterable by: entity type, field, resolution status, source pair
- FR-09.5: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation auto-generated

### FR-10: Auth (existing + additions)
- FR-10.1: Existing User + JWT + BCrypt reused
- FR-10.2: ADMIN role: all operations
- FR-10.3: ANALYST role: read-only on all endpoints + conflict acknowledgement

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-01: Observability
- Every IngestionJob exposes real-time status and record counts
- QualityScore history accessible per source
- ConflictRecord counts surfaced in source detail

### NFR-02: Data Integrity
- StagedRecords persist until canonical load confirmed — no silent drops
- Kafka offsets committed only after staged record written to DB
- Spring Batch jobs use Postgres-backed JobRepository — job state survives restart

### NFR-03: Reproducibility
- Any staged batch can be reprocessed (re-run transformation + quality + load) if mapping rules change
- Flyway ensures schema is identical across environments

### NFR-04: Debuggability
- Every canonical record traceable to exact source record and transformations applied
- QualityIssues reference the specific field and value that caused the violation
- ConflictRecords show both values and both sources

### NFR-05: Local Deployability
- Full stack runs with `docker-compose up`
- No paid services required
- Canonical Postgres schema accessible on localhost:5432 for direct query tool connection

---

## Constraints
- Language: Java, Spring Boot 4
- Database: Postgres (already running)
- Infrastructure: Docker Compose only (no cloud hosting required)
- Auth: existing implementation must not be broken
- Frontend: React or Vue (basic, functional — not a design showcase)
- Kafka: Docker only, not managed cloud

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- User-configurable canonical schema
- CRM/ERP REST API connectors (Salesforce, SAP)
- ML anomaly detection
- Email/webhook alerting
- Multi-tenancy
- Horizontal scaling
- Cloud deployment (unless added later)

## What "Conflict" Means — Precisely

A conflict is a field-level disagreement between two sources on the same real-world entity, where both values are plausible.

**Customer conflicts:**
- `segment`: Source A = "Consumer", Source B = "Corporate" → CONFLICT
- `region`: Source A = "West", Source B = "Northwest" → CONFLICT
- `email`: differs between sources → CONFLICT

**Product conflicts:**
- `unit_price`: differs by more than 1% between sources → CONFLICT
- `category`: differs → CONFLICT
- `sub_category`: differs → CONFLICT

**Order conflicts:**
- `total_amount`: differs by more than $0.01 → CONFLICT
- `ship_mode`: differs → CONFLICT

**Not a conflict:**
- A null value in one source where the other has a value → COMPLETENESS issue, not conflict (the non-null wins by default)
- A field that only exists in one source → merge silently
- Rounding differences under threshold → not a conflict

---

## Phase-by-Phase Build Plan

---

### Phase 1 — Infrastructure Foundation
**Goal:** Full stack runs. App starts. Tables exist. You can produce and consume a Kafka message.
**Prerequisite:** Nothing. This is Day 1.

**Tasks:**
1. Write `docker-compose.yml`:
  - Postgres (map to 5432 — you already use this, so map carefully or use 5433 for Docker)
  - Redis (6379)
  - Kafka with KRaft (no Zookeeper): use `confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0` with KRaft env vars
  - Kafka UI (optional but extremely helpful: `provectuslabs/kafka-ui`)
2. Add all new dependencies to `pom.xml`
3. Fix MapStruct + Lombok compiler plugin ordering
4. Write `application.yml` with datasource, redis, kafka, batch config
5. Write V1 migration (users — your existing schema)
6. Write V2 migration (data_sources table)
7. Confirm app starts: `mvn spring-boot:run`
8. Kafka proof-of-concept (before integrating with app):
  - Use Kafka CLI inside Docker: create topic → produce → consume
  - Write one `@KafkaListener` bean that logs whatever it receives
  - Write one `KafkaTemplate.send()` call from a `/test/kafka` endpoint
  - See message arrive in listener log
9. Write V3–V11 migrations (all tables)
10. Write all @Entity classes

**Done when:** App starts, all tables exist in Postgres, you send a test Kafka message and see it logged.

**What you learn:** KRaft Kafka setup (no Zookeeper), Spring Batch JobRepository autoconfiguration, Flyway migration ordering, MapStruct + Lombok compiler interaction

---

### Phase 2 — Source Registry + CSV Ingestion
**Goal:** Register a data source. Upload a CSV. See raw rows in staged_records.

**Tasks:**
1. `DataSource` entity + repository + `DataSourceService`
2. `SourceController`: `POST /api/v1/sources`, `GET /api/v1/sources`, `GET /api/v1/sources/{id}`
3. `IngestionJob` entity + repository
4. `StagedRecord` entity + repository
5. `CsvIngestionJobConfig` using Spring Batch:
  - `FlatFileItemReader` with `DefaultLineMapper` and `DelimitedLineTokenizer`
  - Header detection (first row = field names)
  - `StagingItemWriter`: write each row as a `StagedRecord` with raw payload as JSONB
  - `IngestionJob` created at batch start, updated on completion
6. `IngestionController`: `POST /api/v1/ingest/csv` (multipart file upload + sourceId)
7. `GET /api/v1/jobs`, `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}`

**Done when:** Upload a CSV with 1000 rows, see 1000 StagedRecords in DB, see IngestionJob show COMPLETED.

**What you learn:** Spring Batch SimpleJob vs ChunkJob, FlatFileItemReader config, multipart file handling in Spring Boot, Spring Batch JobRepository (uses its own tables — they appear automatically)

---

### Phase 3 — Schema Inference
**Goal:** After CSV staged, system infers what each column contains and stores it.

**Tasks:**
1. `TypeDetectionService`:
  - `detectType(List<String> sampleValues)` → returns `InferredType` enum
  - Logic: try parse as Integer → Decimal → Boolean → Date (multiple format attempts) → DateTime → Email regex → Phone regex → Currency → then cardinality check (< 20 unique values in sample = CATEGORY) → else FREE_TEXT
  - `detectDateFormat(List<String> sampleValues)` → returns pattern string
2. `SchemaInferenceService`:
  - Takes a completed IngestionJob
  - Samples up to 500 StagedRecords from the job
  - Runs `TypeDetectionService` per field
  - Computes: null_rate, unique_count, top_10_values (as JSONB array), min/max for numeric
  - Writes `SourceSchema` + `SourceSchemaField` records
  - Writes `DataProfile` + `FieldProfile` records
  - On subsequent jobs: compares to previous schema version → writes new version if drift detected
3. `SchemaController`: `GET /api/v1/sources/{id}/schema`, `GET /api/v1/sources/{id}/schema/drift`
4. Wire `SchemaInferenceService` to run automatically after CSV batch completes

**Done when:** Upload Kaggle Superstore CSV. Query schema endpoint. See every column with its inferred type and null rate. Upload again with one column removed. See drift detected.

**What you learn:** Statistical sampling strategy, how to build a type inference chain, schema versioning design

---

### Phase 4 — Semantic Field Mapping
**Goal:** Source fields auto-mapped to canonical fields. Low-confidence ones flagged for review.

**Tasks:**
1. Define canonical field registry — a static map of all canonical fields across all six entities, with their expected type and synonyms:
   ```
   customer.name → type: FREE_TEXT, synonyms: [customer_name, cust_name, client_name, buyer_name]
   order.total_amount → type: DECIMAL, synonyms: [total, sales, revenue, order_total, amount]
   product.sku → type: FREE_TEXT, synonyms: [sku, product_code, item_code, prod_id]
   ...
   ```
2. `SemanticMapperService.generateMappings(SourceSchema)`:
  - For each source field:
    a. Normalize name (lowercase, strip underscores/spaces)
    b. Exact match against canonical field names and synonyms → confidence 1.0
    c. Levenshtein distance ≤ 2 → confidence 0.85
    d. Token overlap (split on underscore/space, intersect token sets) → confidence 0.70
    e. Same inferred type + cardinality profile matches a canonical field → confidence 0.55
    f. Below 0.55 → UNMAPPED, stored as IGNORED
  - Write `FieldMapping` per source field with confidence + status (AUTO_CONFIRMED if ≥ 0.80, PENDING if < 0.80)
3. `MappingController`:
  - `GET /api/v1/sources/{id}/mappings` — list all with confidence and status
  - `PUT /api/v1/sources/{id}/mappings/{fieldId}/confirm` — confirm pending mapping
  - `PUT /api/v1/sources/{id}/mappings/{fieldId}/override` — change target canonical field
  - `PUT /api/v1/sources/{id}/mappings/{fieldId}/ignore` — mark as IGNORED
4. `TransformationService`: given a `StagedRecord` + confirmed `FieldMappings`, apply transforms and return a normalized map ready for quality checks

**Done when:** Register Kaggle Superstore as source. See all fields mapped. Verify "Customer Name" → customer.name (exact), "Postal Code" → PENDING (ambiguous). Confirm it. See status change.

**What you learn:** Fuzzy matching algorithms, confidence thresholds, how to model a mapping engine as data rather than code

---

### Phase 5 — Quality Engine
**Goal:** Every staged record evaluated across quality dimensions. Issues persisted. Score computed.

**Tasks:**
1. `QualityEngineService.runQualityCheck(IngestionJob)`:
  - Iterates transformed records
  - Runs all checkers in sequence
  - Aggregates issues into a `QualityRun`
  - Computes `QualityScore` (per dimension and overall)
2. Implement each checker as a separate `@Component`:
  - `CompletenessChecker`: for each required canonical field, check null rate. Issue if field null rate > 10% above profile baseline.
  - `ValidityChecker`: value conforms to inferred type. Date values parseable by detected format. Email matches regex. Amount is non-negative. Issue per failing record+field.
  - `UniquenessChecker`: query canonical store for existing record with same natural key. If found from same source → duplicate. Issue written, record skipped.
  - `ConsistencyChecker`: line_total = quantity × unit_price (within $0.01). order total = sum of line item totals. order_date ≤ today.
  - `TimelinessChecker`: order_date not more than 730 days in the past (configurable). order_date not in future.
  - `AccuracyChecker`: currency code in ISO-4217 set. Country name/code in reference set.
3. `QualityScoreService.compute(List<QualityIssue>, int totalRecords)`:
  - Score per dimension = 1.0 − (critical_issues × 1.0 + high × 0.5 + medium × 0.2 + low × 0.05) / totalRecords, clamped to [0, 1]
  - Overall = weighted average (completeness 20%, validity 25%, uniqueness 20%, consistency 20%, timeliness 10%, accuracy 5%)
  - Grade: A ≥ 0.95, B ≥ 0.85, C ≥ 0.70, D ≥ 0.55, F < 0.55
4. `QualityController`:
  - `GET /api/v1/quality/issues` (paginated, filterable)
  - `GET /api/v1/quality/scores` (per source, over time)
  - `GET /api/v1/quality/summary`
  - `PUT /api/v1/quality/issues/{id}/acknowledge`
5. Records with CRITICAL issues written to a `rejected_records` table with reason. All others proceed.

**Done when:** Run Superstore CSV through quality. See completeness score. Manually insert a row with negative amount — see ValidityChecker catch it as HIGH severity issue. See overall score as letter grade.

**What you learn:** How to model quality as data, weighted scoring, why checkers should be separate components (different failure modes), reference data validation

---

### Phase 6 — Conflict Detection + Canonical Load
**Goal:** Records that pass quality are loaded to canonical tables. Cross-source conflicts detected and stored.

**Tasks:**
1. `CanonicalLoadService.load(IngestionJob)`:
  - For each quality-passing transformed record:
    a. Determine entity type (customer, product, order, etc.)
    b. Look up canonical store by external_ref from source
    c. If not found → INSERT new canonical record, write lineage
    d. If found, same source → UPDATE (same source refreshing its data)
    e. If found, different source → run conflict detection
2. `ConflictDetectionService.detect(CanonicalEntity existing, TransformedRecord incoming)`:
  - Compare each conflicting field (defined in FR-06.2)
  - For each differing field: write `ConflictRecord`
  - Apply configured resolution strategy
  - Update canonical record with resolved value
  - Set `has_conflicts = true`
3. `LineageService.write(...)`: after each canonical write, persist lineage record
4. `ConflictController`:
  - `GET /api/v1/conflicts` (filterable by entity type, field, status, source)
  - `GET /api/v1/conflicts/{id}`
  - `PUT /api/v1/conflicts/{id}/resolve` (body: chosen_value)
  - `PUT /api/v1/conflicts/{id}/suppress`

**Done when:** Load Superstore CSV. Load a second CSV of the same customers with different segment values. See ConflictRecords in DB. See `has_conflicts = true` on those canonical customers. Resolve one conflict via API. See it update.

**What you learn:** Upsert semantics with conflict tracking, the difference between quality (record-level) and conflict (cross-source entity-level), lineage modeling

---

### Phase 7 — Excel + JDBC Connectors
**Goal:** Two more source types working through the same pipeline.

**Tasks:**
1. **Excel connector:**
  - `ExcelIngestionJobConfig` using Apache POI `XSSFWorkbook`
  - Read first row as headers, iterate subsequent rows
  - Convert each row to a flat map (field → string value)
  - Write to `StagedRecord` identically to CSV connector
  - Scope: flat tabular sheets only. Multi-sheet: use first sheet. Merged cells: treat as null.
2. **JDBC connector:**
  - `JdbcIngestionJobConfig` using Spring Batch `JdbcCursorItemReader`
  - Connection URL, credentials, table/query stored on `DataSource` entity (encrypted with AES in connectionConfig JSONB)
  - `JdbcIngestionScheduler`: reads all ACTIVE JDBC sources, checks if next scheduled pull is due (cron-based), triggers batch job
  - During dev: use your existing local Postgres as the "legacy database" target — create a separate schema with sample data

**Done when:** Upload an Excel file with the same Superstore data. See it staged and processed. Create a JDBC source pointing at a local Postgres table. See records pulled on schedule.

**What you learn:** Apache POI workbook iteration, JdbcCursorItemReader, Spring @Scheduled, storing and decrypting connection credentials

---

### Phase 8 — Kafka Live Stream Connector
**Goal:** A live Kafka topic streams sales events. They flow through the same pipeline as batch data.

**Tasks:**
1. Define Kafka message schema for live sales events (JSON). This is what would come from a POS system, e-commerce platform, etc.:
   ```json
   {
     "event_id": "uuid",
     "source_system": "pos_terminal_01",
     "event_time": "2024-03-15T14:22:00Z",
     "customer_ref": "C-9912",
     "product_ref": "SKU-441",
     "salesperson_ref": "SP-07",
     "quantity": 3,
     "unit_price": 49.99,
     "total_amount": 149.97,
     "currency": "USD",
     "region": "West"
   }
   ```
2. `LiveSalesEventConsumer`:
  - `@KafkaListener` on `sales.live` topic
  - Deserialize JSON → `StagedRecord`
  - Create or reuse the `IngestionJob` for the source (one long-running job per Kafka source, or one job per hour — your design decision)
  - Write `StagedRecord` to DB
  - Commit offset ONLY after staged record written
3. Wire the same inference/mapping/quality/conflict/canonical pipeline to process staged records from Kafka source
4. Write a test producer script (Python or Java main) that publishes 100 fake sales events to `sales.live` topic
5. Watch them flow through end-to-end

**This is the hardest phase.** The complexity is: Kafka consumers run in their own thread. DB transactions, Spring Batch jobs, and Kafka offsets must be carefully coordinated. Do not rush this.

**Done when:** Run test producer. See 100 events land in staged_records. See them quality-checked and loaded to canonical tables. See quality score for the Kafka source.

**What you learn:** Kafka consumer offset management, consumer group semantics, transaction boundaries between Kafka and database, idempotent processing

---

### Phase 9 — Redis Caching + API Polish
**Goal:** Quality scores and conflict summaries cached. All list endpoints paginated and filterable.

**Tasks:**
1. `QualityCacheService`:
  - Key: `quality:score:{sourceId}:{jobId}` TTL 30 minutes
  - Key: `quality:summary:{sourceId}` TTL 15 minutes
  - Key: `conflicts:summary:{sourceId}` TTL 15 minutes
  - Invalidate relevant keys when new job completes for source
2. Add `Pageable` to all list endpoints
3. Add filter params: QualityIssues by (sourceId, dimension, severity, jobId, status), Conflicts by (entityType, field, status, source1Id, source2Id)
4. Add `@PreAuthorize` to all endpoints (was likely already there for auth but confirm)
5. Springdoc OpenAPI: add to pom, verify Swagger UI works at `/swagger-ui.html`
6. `CanonicalController`: query endpoints for each canonical entity with pagination (this is secondary — external tools connect directly to Postgres, but having an API is useful for the frontend)

**Done when:** Hit a quality score endpoint twice in quick succession, verify second response is cached (log Redis hit). Open Swagger UI, see all endpoints documented.

---

### Phase 10 — Frontend (React)
**Goal:** A working dashboard a potential customer could look at and understand the value.

**Five pages, nothing more:**

1. **Login** — standard, uses your existing auth endpoint

2. **Sources** — list registered sources, register new source, see last sync time, quality score badge per source

3. **Ingestion** — upload CSV/Excel, see active jobs with real-time status (polling), see record counts (staged, quality passed, loaded, rejected)

4. **Quality Dashboard** — select a source → see quality score per dimension as a bar chart, quality trend over time as a line chart (Chart.js or Recharts), issues table with severity filter

5. **Conflicts** — table of open conflicts, each row shows: entity type, field, Source A value, Source B value, resolution strategy, resolve/suppress buttons

**Approach:** Vite + React, Axios for API calls, Recharts for charts, TailwindCSS for styling (utility classes, no custom CSS files). JWT stored in memory (not localStorage — use a React context).

---

### Phase 11 — Docker Compose + README
**Goal:** Someone can clone the repo and run the entire system in one command.

**docker-compose.yml services:**
- `db`: postgres:16
- `redis`: redis:7-alpine
- `kafka`: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0 (KRaft mode)
- `kafka-ui`: provectuslabs/kafka-ui (for local debugging)
- `app`: your Spring Boot app (build from Dockerfile)
- `frontend`: your React app (nginx container serving built static files)

**README must include:**
- What this system does (2 paragraphs, clear)
- Architecture diagram (ASCII is fine)
- Prerequisites: Docker, Docker Compose
- How to run: `docker-compose up --build`
- How to connect external tools: Postgres connection string for canonical schema
- Known scope boundaries (Excel: flat sheets only, Kafka: local only, etc.)
- API docs link (Swagger)

---

## What You Will Be Able To Say

**"What problem does this solve?"**
Sales data arrives from multiple systems — a CRM, a legacy ERP, point-of-sale streams, exported spreadsheets. Each uses different field names, formats, and conventions for the same real-world entities. Most companies have no unified view of their own sales data. This system ingests from all those sources, infers their schemas, maps fields to a canonical sales model, evaluates every record across six quality dimensions, detects cross-source conflicts, and produces a single clean database that analysis tools can trust.

**"What's genuinely hard in this system?"**
Three things: the semantic mapper, which infers field equivalence statistically rather than requiring manual configuration; the conflict model, which persists cross-source disagreements as first-class queryable entities rather than silently overwriting; and the quality engine, which evaluates data against a statistical baseline so it catches drift that hardcoded rules miss.

**"How does a customer actually use this without migrating their data?"**
They don't migrate anything. They register their existing Postgres or MySQL database as a JDBC source. The system pulls from it on a schedule. Their data stays where it is. The canonical store is additive — a clean unified copy, not a replacement.

**"What does a conflict actually mean in your system?"**
It means two sources provided different values for the same real-world entity. I defined conflicts precisely by entity type — customer segment disagreements, product price differences over 1%, order total differences over a cent. Each conflict is a queryable record showing both values, both sources, the resolution strategy applied, and the current status. Nothing is silently overwritten.
